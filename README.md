Guidebee Game Engine
=================

 Guidebee Game Engine(GGE), whose core is based on libgdx ,but instead of trying to be a cross-platform game 
 visualization development framework, GGE is focus on Android platform and provide much easier Game API 
 interfaces and enforce game development best practices  for Android game developers, and since it’s just
 a game engine (library) for Android ,you can still access all features Android platform supports quite easily.
 GGE has build-in Box2D physics support, Entity System Framework for cleaner game logic design, 
 Tween Engine and Actions for Animations, 99% of the time you don’t need to know anything about OpenGL ES
 before you start game programming, supports SVG rendering and vector drawings. it also provides Java ME
 Game API similar interfaces thus make it more convenient to port old Java ME games to Android platform. 
 It also makes most collision detection algorithms available for majorities of all game scenarios.
